We present an analytical method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of target organisms in mixed samples that achieves a high degree of species-and strain-specificity by aligning short sequence reads to the genomes of near neighbor organisms, as well as that of the target. Empirical benchmarking alongside the current state-of-the-art methods shows an extremely high Positive Predictive Value, even at very low abundances of the target organism in a mixed sample. SIANN is available as an Illumina BaseSpace app, as well as through Signature Science, LLC. SIANN results are presented in a streamlined report designed to be comprehensible to the non-specialist user, providing a powerful tool for rapid species detection in a mixed sample. By focusing on a set of (customizable) target organisms and their near neighbors, SIANN can operate quickly and with low computational requirements while delivering highly accurate results.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}], 'body_text': [{'text': 'There are many different methods that characterize the mixture of organisms present within a metagenomic dataset. Such datasets are generated when a complex environmental sample is processed by a \"next-generation\" high-throughput genome sequencing protocol, and they consist of large numbers of short nucleotide sequences. Each sequence represents a small fragment of a randomly selected genome from the very large collection of genomes present in the source sample. Those sequences indicate the presence of one organism or another according to their similarity to a set of known reference genomes. While a given sequence may be unique to one species, it also may be found in diverse organisms across the tree of life. Therefore, one analytical challenge (among many) is to take that collection of sequences (likely numbering in the millions) and accurately determine what species are present in the sample. Here we describe a novel method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) that is specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of targeted organisms from a metagenomic dataset by aligning reads to genomic regions that are unique at the strain or species level.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Introduction'}, {'text': \"The analytical question motivating a particular piece of metagenomic bioinformatic analysis may vary widely by user and sample type (Segata, et al., 2013) .

In contrast, the clinical treatment of a patient may depend on whether or not a particular virus, or a consortium of co-infecting pathogens, is/are detected in their blood. It is this second class of presence/absence questions that SIANN is designed to address.

They generally require reference databases that are very large and/or require a large amount of processing to generate. The gap SIANN is designed to fill is when the entire tree of life is irrelevant, and only predefined subsets of organisms need to be detected. For an underlying method we chose read alignment to diagnostic genomic regions because the algorithms for read alignment are highly parallelizable and have been optimized heavily by the community at large (the current implementation of SIANN uses bowtie2 [Langmead & Salzberg, 2012] for the alignment function, but can be adapted to any alignment algorithm). This approach is distinct from using cladespecific marker genes (Segata, et al., 2012) because unique regions that are larger, smaller, or outside of genes can also be used. Furthermore, this approach supports the rapid construction of custom databases using reference genome sets that require only minimal user-supplied structure.', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 39, 'end': 66, 'text': 'Huson, et al., 2011 PhymmBL', 'ref_id': None}, {'start': 138, 'end': 160, 'text': 'Brady & Salzberg, 2011', 'ref_id': None}, {'start': 213, 'end': 225, 'text': 'Liu, et al.,', 'ref_id': None}, {'start': 922, 'end': 949, 'text': '[Langmead & Salzberg, 2012]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF7'}, {'start': 1090, 'end': 1112, 'text': '(Segata, et al., 2012)', 'ref_id': None}], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Name Method Reference MEGAN'}, {'text': 'To understand the principle at work, consider a set of reads that have been aligned to the genomes of several strains belonging to two species.

After that normalization factor is applied, the resulting score indicates whether the source sample contained any of the organisms in the reference database. Figure 1 . A) For a group of strains belonging to two different species, some regions may be unique to each species (region 1), while other regions may be unique to strains within each species (regions 2 and 3).

In this example, Strain B of Species I is the organism identified.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [{'start': 690, 'end': 698, 'text': 'Figure 1', 'ref_id': None}], 'section': 'Name Method Reference MEGAN'}, {'text': 'The analysis is conducted independently on both the species and the strain level, so that if the true strain is not present in the database, the species of origin will still be identified. While many methods consider the complete taxonomic tree and assign reads to the least common ancestor, SIANN considers only two taxonomic levels: species and strain, throwing out anything that is not unique at one of those levels and thus obviating many of the confounding factors introduced by manually curated taxonomies.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Name Method Reference MEGAN'}, {'text': 'The example shown in Figure 1b indicates that species-specific reads are identified as reads that align to one species (Species I, in that case) but not the other. If Species II were not present in the example shown in Figure 1b , a much larger number of reads would be assigned as \"species-specific,\" when in fact those regions are shared with other species. Therefore, the ability of this method to identify strain-and species-specific sequences is a direct function of the inclusion of near neighbors in the reference database. This characteristic is shared among many classification algorithms, but it is of particular note for this method when users have an opportunity to construct their own database.. In order to detect a target species with a high degree of specificity (reducing false positives), it is necessary to include other related species in the reference database. Only by parallel alignment to those near neighbors can the redundant sequences be separated from the species-specific ones. For example, in order to detect Bacillus anthracis in a sample, it would be necessary to include other species of Bacilli in the reference database so that the presence of B. cereus or B. thuringiensis in a sample does not lead to a false call for B. anthracis.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [{'start': 21, 'end': 30, 'text': 'Figure 1b', 'ref_id': None}, {'start': 219, 'end': 228, 'text': 'Figure 1b', 'ref_id': None}], 'section': 'Name Method Reference MEGAN'}, {'text': 'The nomenclature of genus, species, and strain is potentially problematic because it does not correspond to a consistent degree of evolutionary distance or genomic distinctiveness. The ability to distinguish two organisms by any method using genomic sequence data is proportional to the amount of each genome that is shared or unique. One might assume that any two organisms of the same species will have a relatively predictable amount of shared genomic identity. However, some pairs of organisms from the same species may have less in common than other pairs of organisms from different species or even genera. This ambiguity impacts SIANN in two ways. If two organisms have very little genomic sequence to distinguish them, the sensitivity of SIANN to detect either one will diminish (the rate of false negatives will increase as the likelihood of sequencing unique regions decreases). Conversely, if an organism is extremely dissimilar to the near neighbors selected for the database, the specificity with which SIANN detects that organism will decline (the rate of false positives will increase as the number of related genomes available in the database decreases). For example, if a database contained only E. coli and B.anthracis, a sample containing B. cereus would be misidentified as contraining B. anthracis. In the intended use case, a database targeting B. anthracis would contain B. cereus and a number of other near neighbors to prevent that kind of misidentification. It would be convenient to say that an ideal database can be made by calculating the ideal genetic distance between all references and then finding an ideal set of organisms to make up that database, but the behavior of any database will be governed by the particular genomes of the organisms it encounters in the wild. Because not all organisms evolve in the same manner (differences in mutation rate, horizontal gene transfer, recombination, etc), the suitability of a database and method to detect a given organism can only be determined by thorough validation and benchmarking, as well as updating the reference database as needed. Users of SIANN may construct their own custom databases to include newly identified genomes or specific subsets of genomes that best suit their research interests.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Name Method Reference MEGAN'}, {'text': 'Steps to construct a custom database:', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Name Method Reference MEGAN'}, {'text': '1.

All of the programs in Table 1 were investigated for this effort, and three were chosen based on their ability to run on our high-performance computing cluster with an execution time and memory requirement that would be suitable to a clinical lab. Each program was run on a set of 600 simulated datasets generated by MetaSim (Richter, et al., 2008) . Each dataset consisted of 15,000,000 reads (100bp single-ended) with Illumina-simulated error (fourth-degree polynomial) (Korbel, et al., 2009) .

Kraken and LMAT both count the reads assigned to each taxon, MetaPhlAn calculates the abundance, and SIANN outputs a measure of the proportion of diagnostic genomic regions present. To put these measures on an even footing, we empirically calculated the false positive rate for each method over all 600 samples, at each possible measure of output. Because each dataset is made up of known organisms, any result can be classified as true or false. Therefore, for any possible result (say, 513 reads classified by LMAT or 1.6% abundance assigned by MetaPhlAn), one can calculate the proportion of calls with at least the same amount of support that were correct (True Positives/[True Positives+False Positives]), over all of the 600 datasets. That measure is commonly given as Positive Predictive Value (PPV). For each program, the results can be translated from the raw value into a PPV that is based on this empirical measure of error. The key item of interest is the PPV value for the results that we know to be true positives, the defined spike organisms. Another way of describing this approach is to say that the results of each program have been normalized to the false positive error rate that was empirically observed. If another set of samples were generated, the PPV vs. raw value curve ( Figure 2 ) would likely fall differently, but in this case it gives us a means of comparing a diverse set of methods against the same ground truth. If method 1 detects an organism with a higher PPV than method 2 does, it means that method 1 has fewer false positives in the range that it reports true positives, which is the definition of utility in this setting.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [{'start': 1339, 'end': 1347, 'text': 'Figure 2', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF0'}], 'section': 'Benchmarking'}, {'text': 'For each method, PPV was calculated as a function of raw output value.

Some simplification steps were taken, such as focusing on the specieslevel assignments (for comparison with methods that do not perform strain assignment), and only taking the top hit for each species from each dataset.

One could identify a read that aligns to a single species of bacteria with 100% accuracy over its 300bp length, with the next closest match being only 90% similar. It is extremely unlikely that a 300bp exact match would arise due to random chance, and so the user could say with confidence that the organism of interest is found within the sequence data (not considering contamination, horizontal gene transfer, etc). However, such an approach is not currently implemented in an automated method, and many of the steps needed to make that assertion are performed manually by a domain expert, including alignment to near neighbors and ensuring that the read does not fall within a transposon, plasmid, etc. Therefore, while one could say that a single read is all that is needed to state with high PPV that an organism is present, the amount of reads assigned in an automated manner needed to achieve that level of PPV will number in the thousands (Fig 2) . Table 2 ), and each program (boxes at top), across a maximum of 50 replicates (indicated by the size of each point).

To demonstrate this we plotted the known abundance of each spike organism against the PPV value generated by each method (Figure 3 ). Each point (an organism at a known level of abundance) is comprised of a maximum of 50 replicates, where the diameter of each point increases with an increasing number of replicates. For demonstration purposes we are showing two pairs of bacteria and three viruses. Recall that for each of the pairs of bacteria (and the two poxviruses) any sample containing one did not contain the other (as shown in Table 1 ). The empty boxes result from the organisms not being called at any abundance. For MetaPhlAn, that is a result of no viruses being included in the version of the reference database available for this analysis. Kraken assigned no reads to Hanta virus because viral RNA genomes were not included in this version of the reference database (personal communication with D. Wood). This emphasizes the point that a) the ability to create custom databases targeting organisms of interest can be valuable, and b) the performance of any method must be benchmarked against each potential target of interest.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [{'start': 460, 'end': 469, 'text': '(Figure 3', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF1'}, {'start': 875, 'end': 882, 'text': 'Table 1', 'ref_id': None}], 'section': 'Results'}, {'text': 'All methods were able identify the bulk of organisms in their databases at high abundances (75% and 18%, Figure 3 ), however performance varied considerably at lower abundances and depended on the particular organism and method used.

For example, at the 95% confidence (PPV) cutoff of 0.2, SIANN reliably detects all of the organisms tested here at as low as 0.3% abundance. This strong performance is likely due to the fact that SIANN is able to use a method (read alignment to whole genomes) that would be far too computationally costly if it were applied to the entire collection of known genomes.

To study the dynamics mediating the transmission of emerging diseases, spatial epidemiology of networked metapopulation provides a valuable modeling framework, which takes spatially distributed factors into consideration.

The approach of timescale separation is applied to perform theoretical analysis, since in reality the number of frequent commuters only accounts for a small fraction of local populations. This leads to a mean-field description of stationary populations distribution. Generalizing the theory of branching process, Balcan and Vespignani [97] obtained the global invasion threshold for the reaction-commuting networked metapopulation systems, which establishes a new threshold relevant to the typical visiting duration of commuters.

We sequenced BAC clones from the essentially haploid hydatidiform mole, CHM1, across the light chain IG loci, kappa (IGK) and lambda (IGL), creating single haplotype representations of these regions. The IGL haplotype is 1.25Mb of contiguous sequence with four novel V gene and one novel C gene alleles and an 11.9kbp insertion. The IGK haplotype consists of two 644kbp proximal and 466kbp distal contigs separated by a gap also present in the reference genome sequence. Our effort added an additional 49kbp of unique sequence extending into this gap. The IGK haplotype contains six novel V gene and one novel J gene alleles and a 16.7kbp region with increased sequence identity between the two IGK contigs, exhibiting signatures of interlocus gene conversion. Our data facilitated the first comparison of nucleotide diversity between the light and IG heavy (IGH) chain haplotypes within a single genome, revealing a three to six fold enrichment in the IGH locus, supporting the theory that the heavy chain may be more important in determining antigenic specificity.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}], 'body_text': [{'text': 'Antibodies are essential components of the immune system that play key roles in processes associated with innate and adaptive immunity 1 . They are expressed by B-cells as either cell surface receptors or secreted proteins, and are formed by two pairs of identical \"heavy\" and \"light\" immunoglobulin (IG) protein chains, encoded by genes located at three primary loci in the human genome: the IG heavy chain (IGH) at 14q32.33, and the two IG light chain regions, lambda (IGL) and kappa (IGK), located at 22q11.2 and 2p11.2 2 . Specifically, through a unique mechanism referred to as V-(D)-J recombination 3 , individual Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) genes at the IGH locus, and V and J genes at either the IGK or IGL loci recombine somatically at the DNA level to generate templates for the subsequent transcription and translation of antibody heavy and light chains, respectively. V-(D)-J recombination is accompanied by the random addition and deletion of nucleotides at the junctions of the combined V, D, and J genes by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT). The extreme variability observed in expressed antigen-naïve B-cell antibody repertoires is due to this combinatorial and junctional diversity, and partly ensures that the immune system is able to recognize and mount effective immune responses against a diverse range of potential pathogens. At the population and species level, IG haplotype and allelic variation also make important contributions to the diversity of expressed antibody repertoires [4] [5] [6] [7] ; however, broader roles of IG genetic polymorphism in antibody function are generally less well understood 8 .', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 605, 'end': 606, 'text': '3', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF2'}, {'start': 1531, 'end': 1534, 'text': '[4]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF3'}, {'start': 1535, 'end': 1538, 'text': '[5]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF4'}, {'start': 1539, 'end': 1542, 'text': '[6]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF5'}, {'start': 1543, 'end': 1546, 'text': '[7]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF6'}, {'start': 1655, 'end': 1656, 'text': '8', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF7'}], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Introduction'}, {'text': 'Over the past three decades, extensive catalogues of genetic polymorphisms have been established for human IGH, IGK, and IGL genes (IMGT; the international ImMunoGeneTics information system; www.imgt.org 2, 9 ) .

However, our understanding of germline variability at the IGH, IGK, and IGL loci remains severely limited, especially in terms of haplotype structure (i.e., large segmental duplications and deletions) as well as coding and non-coding sequence polymorphisms. We have begun to uncover this variability in the IGH locus, leading to complete nucleotide resolution descriptions of large structural variants (insertions, deletions, duplications, and complex rearrangements), including novel functional IGHV genes and alleles 7 .', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 204, 'end': 206, 'text': '2,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF1'}, {'start': 207, 'end': 210, 'text': '9 )', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF8'}, {'start': 349, 'end': 352, 'text': '[4]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF3'}, {'start': 353, 'end': 356, 'text': '[5]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF4'}, {'start': 357, 'end': 360, 'text': '[6]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF5'}, {'start': 552, 'end': 559, 'text': '10-12 .', 'ref_id': None}, {'start': 1079, 'end': 1080, 'text': '7', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF6'}], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Introduction'}, {'text': 'In the present study we use the same approach as our previous characterization of IGH to analyze complete haploid reconstructions of the IGK and IGL loci, which to date, compared to IGH, remain less well investigated.

The region spans approximately 0.9 MB, and includes 69 IGLV, seven IGLJ, and seven IGLC functional/open reading frame (ORF) genes and pseudogenes. Additional V, J, and C genes not present in this haplotype are known to occur as insertion variants in the human population 2, [14] [15] [16] .

However, fully understanding the relationship between segmental duplication and SNP density in the human IG regions will undoubtedly require further sequencing and comparisons of additional haplotypes. We must also acknowledge the potential for confounding effects related to the use of mosaic reference sequences for this comparison 13,17,31 , which were generated from multiple large insert libraries constructed from diploid tissues, in some cases of unknown ethnicity. Considering this, it is possible that a comparison of CH17 IG regions to references generated from individuals with different ethnic backgrounds could result in artifactual differences between loci. However, because our findings are supported by existing V gene allelic variation data at the population level, it seems unlikely that the difference in variability between loci is due to ethnic origin of the tissue.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/006866 doi: bioRxiv preprint If the difference in SNP density observed here between the IG V gene clusters is in fact genuine, it raises the question of whether increased genetic diversity in IGH has any functional consequences. Given that SNP density within V gene coding regions in the CH17 haplotype was also higher in IGH compared to IGL and IGK, it could be speculated that mechanisms associated with an increased number of polymorphisms locus-wide in IGHV, could by default, result in greater IGHV gene diversity and a more variable expressed antibody repertoire. Intriguingly, in natural antibodies, the IG heavy chains are considered to play a more prominent role in epitope binding than IG light chains, although this is primarily attributed to residues of the third complementary determining region (CDRH3) not encoded by IGHV gene segments 46 ', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 2002, 'end': 2004, 'text': '46', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF45'}], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Discussion'}, {'text': '.

In the distal region, four complete BACs were assembled into a single contig spanning 60 Kbp upstream of IGLV2D-40 to 22 Kbp downstream of the most distal gene in the locus, IGHV3D-7. This sequence included ~49 kbp of additional sequence (compared to the Kawasaki haplotype) extending into the assembly gap between the proximal and distal units, which is predicted to be 800 kbp 17,26 .

Whether increased genetic diversity in IGHV is associated with the dominant role of the heavy chain in antibody function remains to be seen. In addition, there is still much to be learned about the contribution of IG genetic polymorphism to variability in expressed repertoires and the implications of this variation for susceptibility to infectious and autoimmune diseases, responses to therapeutic antibodies and vaccines, and other clinical outcomes.

The large amount of data generated provides an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively interpret potentially complex metagenomic mixtures. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. This interpretation problem can be formulated statistically as a mixture model, where the species of origin of each read is missing, but the complete knowledge of all species present in the mixture helps with the individual reads assignment. Several analytical tools have been proposed to approximately solve this computational problem. Here, we show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. The added accuracy comes at a cost of increased computation time. Our approach is useful for solving complex mixtures involving several related species. We designed our method specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets and with a particular focus on viral pathogen detection, but the principles are applicable more generally to all types of metagenomics mixtures.

Lastly, the number of reads originating from a disease causing pathogen can be low (Barzon et al., 2013) .

MEGAN addresses ambiguous matches by assigning reads that have multiple possible assignments to several species, to the taxonomic group containing all these species, or else their lowest common ancestor (LCA). This approach is accurate on a higher taxonomic level. However, it is lacking a formal solution to resolving ambiguous matches. A weakness of the similarity based methods is that a long tail of species, each supported only by a few reads can appear in the results. This results from the classification being decided one read at a time, in contrast to considering all reads simultaneously.

These ideas have been applied in the metagenomics context in frequentist (GRAMMy (Xia et al., 2011) ) and Bayesian (Pathoscope (Francis et al., 2013) ) settings. GRAMMy formulates the problem as a finite mixture model, using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the relative genome abundances. Pathoscope refines this process by penalizing reads with ambiguous matches in the presence of reads with unique matches and enforcing parsimony within a Bayesian context. Both methods work with unassembled sequence data and they are not currently setup to incorporate an initial short read assembly step, which could be achieved by assigning a higher weight to contigs formed by multiple reads. Fitting a mixture model is useful for the species relative abundance estimation, as well as the read to species assignment. A related but distinct question concerns the set of species which should be included in the mixture model. This question is closely related to the biological question of asking what species are present in the mixture. Including all species flagged as potential matches by the read classification can introduce a large number of species, often in the low thousands. Mixture models will, in this situation, identify a large number of species at low levels. This interpretation is appropriate in some applications. In many other cases, the expectation is that the underlying species set should be parsimonious and that some divergence with database species or sequencing errors can explain a large fraction of the non matching reads.', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 429, 'end': 447, 'text': '(Xia et al., 2011)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF26'}, {'start': 475, 'end': 497, 'text': '(Francis et al., 2013)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF9'}], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Introduction'}, {'text': 'Hence, a better statistical formulation of the community profiling problem is the exploration of the candidate organisms state-space.

Our strategy is based on parallel tempering, a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique, using parallel computing to speed up the inference.

The method is applied to a previous FMD outbreak to identify areas where over confidence in previously inferred direct transmission may exist. Conclusion: Combining knowledge from viral evolution and epidemiology within a single integrated transmission inference framework is an important approach to assess the potential likelihood of transmission events and makes clear how specific features of a virus' spread through the course of an outbreak will directly determine the potential for confidence in inferred host transmission links. Background Developing methods to protect against RNA virus outbreaks in the face of constantly changing disease dynamics remains one of the great public health challenges of our time. One small piece of this problem involves determining the host-pathogen transmission history to identify an outbreak's origin. In recent cases such as the 2003 SARS outbreak [1, 2], H5N1 influenza [3] infection in humans and Marburgvirus [4], phylogenetic inference has been used to help identify potential outbreak sources. Typically, a collection of sequences from candidate related sources are compared to infer transmission links between the most closely related sequences. These methods have been used beyond the public health domain to provide evidence in HIV [5, 6] and other forensic investigations [7] to help infer when a suspect is involved in infecting a victim. P (δ, σ|M ) rather than P (δ|M ). This reflects the desire to estimate the probability of observing the genetic relation δ in conjunction with infection related timing values for the transmission hypothesis M . The σ parameter values are motivated by a SEIR type infection concept [22], which describes a host in one of four 5 .

Previously a transmission inference framework was described that estimates the probability of viral transmission between two hosts using both viral sequence samples and contact tracing data [14, 15] . The method uses labeled training sets from past outbreaks to correlate models of viral evolution associated with direct transmission and indirect transmission to assign a posterior probability that gives a confidence value for inferring a transmission relationship between two infected hosts. One of the limitations of the approach is the need for a robust training set, which can limit application to novel outbreaks. Even when training data is available, a training set over-represented with local outbreak features could skew confidence values. Thus, there is a need to develop additional tools to mitigate limits introduced from training. One feature that can be difficult to accurately account for with limited exemplars is time series data. The objective of this article is to present an approach to incorporate time series data with molecular genetic sequence data to measure the uncertainty of host to host transmission events in the face of limited training data and variability in host infection times. Efforts to integrate models of epidemiology and genetic evolution have been ongoing for some time [16] [17] [18] [19] , yet less work has focused on the specific problem of measuring the certainty of inferring individual host transmission events. One related effort is a method called SeqTrack, which was used to examine the origins of the 2009 H1N1 outbreak [20] . This work is similar to our previous transmission inference [14] approach with a few key differences. Rather than inferring a host transmission graph, a genealogy tree is inferred where nodes represent sequence samples and edges between nodes link a sequence to putative descendants. Sample collection times exclude some candidate edges and edge weights represent genetic distances between two sequences. The genealogy tree is inferred by finding the directed graph analog of the minimum spanning tree. Given the elapsed time between two sequences and a per day mutation rate, a confidence value is assigned for direct genealogy linkages. The framework presented here is a more general framework where variable within host evolution times are assumed to play a role.

While the Cottam et al. approach evaluates a putative outbreak tree overlaid onto a single phylogenetic tree, our main contribution is to provide a framework that models features of transmission inference not previously considered. In particular, uncertainty in transmission inference is newly captured by explicitly considering unobserved nodes in the outbreak tree and uncertainty of phylogeny through the use of multiple potentially competing phylogenetic inferences. The result is a more realistic measure of uncertainty when assigning a transmission link. The framework's added use of competing transmission hypotheses does, however, come with an increased computational cost.

For clarity the two figures are used to separate the distributions into two classes, those with peaks at M ≤5 and those that peak at M > 5. (Note that the maximal path length observed was 37, however, due to the 2,000 tree node limit, longer path lengths occur less frequently in the 40 trial experiment and thus path lengths with less than 40 observations are not shown.) The results show that the framework assigns a likelihood score that roughly reflects the true underlying path length. In particular, all path lengths less than 10 clearly peak at M=1 or M=5 in the figure. The results do suggest room for improvement, however, since path lengths for M=11-17 still show their maximum likelihood value at M=5. A possible reason for this is that for longer transmission chains the space of inconsistent infection times may expand at a rate that is not proportional to the increase in the number consistent infection times. Since the method uses a fixed random sample size this would favor shorter more constrained transmission hypotheses. Nevertheless, even where the likelihood value peaks at M=5, for longer transmission chains the likelihood values for M > 5 come increasingly closer to the peak until there is finally a peak shift at path length 19 from M=5 to M=10. It is interesting to note that as the path length increases, the peak likelihood value decreases quantifying the increasing ambiguity associated with making long transmission chain inferences. Despite this difficulty, the results indicate that in many cases it may be possible to assign a transmission relationship using a more inclusive class of transmission chain lengths. For example, nodes linked by a transmission path length less than 10 appear to be fairly distinct from those separated by path lengths greater than 20.

Another important area of development is the use of sequence data and a coalescent model to estimate epidemiological parameters. Recent work demonstrates the potential to estimate parameters for a SIR model from genetic sequence data [31] , which could provide an important basis for specifying the epidemiological parameters for transmission inference, when limited non-genome sequence derived observation is available. A strength of the approach is to provide a framework that can readily make use of increasing amounts of knowledge for a particular outbreak. For example, awareness of infections may increase during the course of an outbreak and thus favor using two different priors for the infectious duration times, one at an early outbreak stage and another at a later stage of the outbreak. Other clinical features of infection can be taken into account either by changing prior likelihoods for alternatives in the underlying outbreak tree structure or by making adjustment to priors in the timing distributions.

The figure shows two simple trees, T 0 and T 1 (left and right tree respectively) where the infected hosts are overlaid as circles on the trees to show the transmission event from host X 0 to X 1 in T 0 and Y 0 to Y 1 in T 1 . The larger circle for Y 1 represents a longer infection time and the two trees represent the evolutionary relationship between the sequences. Assuming comparable homogeneous nucleotide substitution rates, the longer branch length in T 1 could be explained by the longer infection time in host Y 1 prior to sampling. Including the direct transmission branch lengths from T 0 and T 1 in a single genetic based transmission inference model leads to a distribution of genetic distances associated with direct transmission for a wider range of values. Thus, estimating accurate confidence values means ensuring that a representative sampling from the true distribution of infection times can be obtained. To measure the impact of this problem, a new method is introduced to incorporate variation in infection times when assigning a final posterior probability confidence value. The proposed method forgoes the use of training data by relying on prior knowledge of viral infection times to act as a constraint in conjunction with phylogenetic data. The results show that with knowledge of infection times confidence in transmission inference can be high and even with limited knowledge of timing patterns, high confidence values can be obtained that exceed the training based methods. Thus, this new transmission inference approach allows for the use of clinical observations of infection to be combined with inferred viral evolution when training data is not available to measure uncertainty associated with specific transmission hypotheses.', 'latex': None, 'type': 'figure'}, 'FIGREF1': {'text': 'Host infection time model.

The directed edges labeled in blue show the path lengths connecting the selected nodes with the path length labels from 1 to the maximum observed (23) for this particular outbreak tree. The tree infers evolutionary relationships that are generally consistent with what would be expected given the different transmission chain lengths observed. For example, a path length of 23 separates node 628 from 1740 and indeed the two nodes end up in two different subclades of the tree. The key question becomes can additional information be obtained by incorporating knowledge of infection times and alternative transmission hypothesis testing with the phylogenetic data to better capture the range of possible relationships among the infected farms. To answer this, we first show the likelihood evaluation for the node pairs taken from the tree in Figure 13 and then show the same likelihood evaluations averaged across all Likelihood values are given for the 12 selected transmission pairs shown in Figure 13. Each node pair is evaluated for different values of M from 1 to 35 and the true path length for each node pair is shown in the legend. randomized outbreak trials. To limit computational costs, evaluated path lengths start with 1 and 5 and continue in intervals of 5 up to 35. The likelihood value P (δ|M ) is reported as the maximal likelihood value for all alternative sub trees of path length M. Figure 14 shows the value of P (δ|M ) for each pair of nodes with node pairs labeled by their true transmission path length. For the sampled outbreak shown in Figure 13, with the exception of M=11, node pairs for path lengths up to 15 show P (δ|M ) values that favor a specific hypothesis or a small subset of hypotheses. As the true path length increases, the average likelihood value drops and the distinction between different path lengths becomes less clear. For the node pair separated by path length of 15 for example, there are clearly higher values for inferring a path length from between 5 and 20, but there is limited distinction within this range. For the most part the framework largely reinforces what is visualized using the consensus phylogenetic tree. An interesting case, however, is the node pair (1255, 1888) linked by a transmission chain of 9, compared with node pair (713, 1119)separated by chain length 13. In the framework, both pairs of nodes have likelihood values that peak at M=5, however the alternative transmission hypotheses for linking (713, 1119) with M=10 or M=15 are much higher than they are for the (1255, 1881) case.

Simulations of an FMD outbreak show how the combined use of the epidemiology based timing constraints with the phylogenetic inferred most recent common ancestor times improve confidence in transmission inference over methods that rely on just one individual feature. The simulations show that labeled training data measuring genetic distance between direct and indirect transmission cases can be used without the additional knowledge of the features of the viral transmission, however, appropriate training data in some cases may not be available. The approach presented is expected to provide a basis for building flexible tools to more readily map inferred viral evolutionary relationships onto epidemiological models to more accurately quantify host transmission relationships.

They generally require reference databases that are very large and/or require a large amount of processing to generate. The gap SIANN is designed to fill is when the entire tree of life is irrelevant, and only predefined subsets of organisms need to be detected. For an underlying method we chose read alignment to diagnostic genomic regions because the algorithms for read alignment are highly parallelizable and have been optimized heavily by the community at large (the current implementation of SIANN uses bowtie2 [Langmead & Salzberg, 2012] for the alignment function, but can be adapted to any alignment algorithm). This approach is distinct from using cladespecific marker genes (Segata, et al., 2012) because unique regions that are larger, smaller, or outside of genes can also be used. Furthermore, this approach supports the rapid construction of custom databases using reference genome sets that require only minimal user-supplied structure.\",\n",

If Species II were not present in the example shown in Figure 1b , a much larger number of reads would be assigned as \\\"species-specific,\\\" when in fact those regions are shared with other species. Therefore, the ability of this method to identify strain-and species-specific sequences is a direct function of the inclusion of near neighbors in the reference database. This characteristic is shared among many classification algorithms, but it is of particular note for this method when users have an opportunity to construct their own database.. In order to detect a target species with a high degree of specificity (reducing false positives), it is necessary to include other related species in the reference database. Only by parallel alignment to those near neighbors can the redundant sequences be separated from the species-specific ones. For example, in order to detect Bacillus anthracis in a sample, it would be necessary to include other species of Bacilli in the reference database so that the presence of B. cereus or B. thuringiensis in a sample does not lead to a false call for B. anthracis.\",\n",

      "            \"text\": \"The nomenclature of genus, species, and strain is potentially problematic because it does not correspond to a consistent degree of evolutionary distance or genomic distinctiveness. The ability to distinguish two organisms by any method using genomic sequence data is proportional to the amount of each genome that is shared or unique. One might assume that any two organisms of the same species will have a relatively predictable amount of shared genomic identity. However, some pairs of organisms from the same species may have less in common than other pairs of organisms from different species or even genera. This ambiguity impacts SIANN in two ways. If two organisms have very little genomic sequence to distinguish them, the sensitivity of SIANN to detect either one will diminish (the rate of false negatives will increase as the likelihood of sequencing unique regions decreases). Conversely, if an organism is extremely dissimilar to the near neighbors selected for the database, the specificity with which SIANN detects that organism will decline (the rate of false positives will increase as the number of related genomes available in the database decreases). For example, if a database contained only E. coli and B.anthracis, a sample containing B. cereus would be misidentified as contraining B. anthracis. In the intended use case, a database targeting B. anthracis would contain B. cereus and a number of other near neighbors to prevent that kind of misidentification. It would be convenient to say that an ideal database can be made by calculating the ideal genetic distance between all references and then finding an ideal set of organisms to make up that database, but the behavior of any database will be governed by the particular genomes of the organisms it encounters in the wild. Because not all organisms evolve in the same manner (differences in mutation rate, horizontal gene transfer, recombination, etc), the suitability of a database and method to detect a given organism can only be determined by thorough validation and benchmarking, as well as updating the reference database as needed. Users of SIANN may construct their own custom databases to include newly identified genomes or specific subsets of genomes that best suit their research interests.\",\n",

Kraken and LMAT both count the reads assigned to each taxon, MetaPhlAn calculates the abundance, and SIANN outputs a measure of the proportion of diagnostic genomic regions present. To put these measures on an even footing, we empirically calculated the false positive rate for each method over all 600 samples, at each possible measure of output. Because each dataset is made up of known organisms, any result can be classified as true or false. Therefore, for any possible result (say, 513 reads classified by LMAT or 1.6% abundance assigned by MetaPhlAn), one can calculate the proportion of calls with at least the same amount of support that were correct (True Positives/[True Positives+False Positives]), over all of the 600 datasets. That measure is commonly given as Positive Predictive Value (PPV). For each program, the results can be translated from the raw value into a PPV that is based on this empirical measure of error. The key item of interest is the PPV value for the results that we know to be true positives, the defined spike organisms. Another way of describing this approach is to say that the results of each program have been normalized to the false positive error rate that was empirically observed. If another set of samples were generated, the PPV vs. raw value curve ( Figure 2 ) would likely fall differently, but in this case it gives us a means of comparing a diverse set of methods against the same ground truth. If method 1 detects an organism with a higher PPV than method 2 does, it means that method 1 has fewer false positives in the range that it reports true positives, which is the definition of utility in this setting.\",\n",

One could identify a read that aligns to a single species of bacteria with 100% accuracy over its 300bp length, with the next closest match being only 90% similar. It is extremely unlikely that a 300bp exact match would arise due to random chance, and so the user could say with confidence that the organism of interest is found within the sequence data (not considering contamination, horizontal gene transfer, etc). However, such an approach is not currently implemented in an automated method, and many of the steps needed to make that assertion are performed manually by a domain expert, including alignment to near neighbors and ensuring that the read does not fall within a transposon, plasmid, etc. Therefore, while one could say that a single read is all that is needed to state with high PPV that an organism is present, the amount of reads assigned in an automated manner needed to achieve that level of PPV will number in the thousands (Fig 2) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/001727 doi: bioRxiv preprint The next phase of benchmarking was to determine how many raw input reads were needed to achieve the threshold for high PPV. To demonstrate this we plotted the known abundance of each spike organism against the PPV value generated by each method (Figure 3 ). Each point (an organism at a known level of abundance) is comprised of a maximum of 50 replicates, where the diameter of each point increases with an increasing number of replicates. For demonstration purposes we are showing two pairs of bacteria and three viruses. Recall that for each of the pairs of bacteria (and the two poxviruses) any sample containing one did not contain the other (as shown in Table 1 ). The empty boxes result from the organisms not being called at any abundance. For MetaPhlAn, that is a result of no viruses being included in the version of the reference database available for this analysis. Kraken assigned no reads to Hanta virus because viral RNA genomes were not included in this version of the reference database (personal communication with D. Wood). This emphasizes the point that a) the ability to create custom databases targeting organisms of interest can be valuable, and b) the performance of any method must be benchmarked against each potential target of interest.\",\n",

For example, at the 95% confidence (PPV) cutoff of 0.2, SIANN reliably detects all of the organisms tested here at as low as 0.3% abundance. This strong performance is likely due to the fact that SIANN is able to use a method (read alignment to whole genomes) that would be far too computationally costly if it were applied to the entire collection of known genomes.

We present an analytical method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of target organisms in mixed samples that achieves a high degree of species-and strain-specificity by aligning short sequence reads to the genomes of near neighbor organisms, as well as that of the target. Empirical benchmarking alongside the current state-of-the-art methods shows an extremely high Positive Predictive Value, even at very low abundances of the target organism in a mixed sample. SIANN is available as an Illumina BaseSpace app, as well as through Signature Science, LLC. SIANN results are presented in a streamlined report designed to be comprehensible to the non-specialist user, providing a powerful tool for rapid species detection in a mixed sample. By focusing on a set of (customizable) target organisms and their near neighbors, SIANN can operate quickly and with low computational requirements while delivering highly accurate results.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Abstract'}], 'body_text': [{'text': 'There are many different methods that characterize the mixture of organisms present within a metagenomic dataset. Such datasets are generated when a complex environmental sample is processed by a \"next-generation\" high-throughput genome sequencing protocol, and they consist of large numbers of short nucleotide sequences. Each sequence represents a small fragment of a randomly selected genome from the very large collection of genomes present in the source sample. Those sequences indicate the presence of one organism or another according to their similarity to a set of known reference genomes. While a given sequence may be unique to one species, it also may be found in diverse organisms across the tree of life. Therefore, one analytical challenge (among many) is to take that collection of sequences (likely numbering in the millions) and accurately determine what species are present in the sample. Here we describe a novel method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) that is specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of targeted organisms from a metagenomic dataset by aligning reads to genomic regions that are unique at the strain or species level.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Introduction'}, {'text': \"The analytical question motivating a particular piece of metagenomic bioinformatic analysis may vary widely by user and sample type (Segata, et al., 2013) .

In contrast, the clinical treatment of a patient may depend on whether or not a particular virus, or a consortium of co-infecting pathogens, is/are detected in their blood. It is this second class of presence/absence questions that SIANN is designed to address.

They generally require reference databases that are very large and/or require a large amount of processing to generate. The gap SIANN is designed to fill is when the entire tree of life is irrelevant, and only predefined subsets of organisms need to be detected. For an underlying method we chose read alignment to diagnostic genomic regions because the algorithms for read alignment are highly parallelizable and have been optimized heavily by the community at large (the current implementation of SIANN uses bowtie2 [Langmead & Salzberg, 2012] for the alignment function, but can be adapted to any alignment algorithm). This approach is distinct from using cladespecific marker genes (Segata, et al., 2012) because unique regions that are larger, smaller, or outside of genes can also be used.

After that normalization factor is applied, the resulting score indicates whether the source sample contained any of the organisms in the reference database. Figure 1 .

If Species II were not present in the example shown in Figure 1b , a much larger number of reads would be assigned as \"species-specific,\" when in fact those regions are shared with other species. Therefore, the ability of this method to identify strain-and species-specific sequences is a direct function of the inclusion of near neighbors in the reference database. This characteristic is shared among many classification algorithms, but it is of particular note for this method when users have an opportunity to construct their own database.. In order to detect a target species with a high degree of specificity (reducing false positives), it is necessary to include other related species in the reference database. Only by parallel alignment to those near neighbors can the redundant sequences be separated from the species-specific ones. For example, in order to detect Bacillus anthracis in a sample, it would be necessary to include other species of Bacilli in the reference database so that the presence of B. cereus or B. thuringiensis in a sample does not lead to a false call for B. anthracis.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [{'start': 21, 'end': 30, 'text': 'Figure 1b', 'ref_id': None}, {'start': 219, 'end': 228, 'text': 'Figure 1b', 'ref_id': None}], 'section': 'Name Method Reference MEGAN'}, {'text': 'The nomenclature of genus, species, and strain is potentially problematic because it does not correspond to a consistent degree of evolutionary distance or genomic distinctiveness. The ability to distinguish two organisms by any method using genomic sequence data is proportional to the amount of each genome that is shared or unique. One might assume that any two organisms of the same species will have a relatively predictable amount of shared genomic identity. However, some pairs of organisms from the same species may have less in common than other pairs of organisms from different species or even genera. This ambiguity impacts SIANN in two ways. If two organisms have very little genomic sequence to distinguish them, the sensitivity of SIANN to detect either one will diminish (the rate of false negatives will increase as the likelihood of sequencing unique regions decreases). Conversely, if an organism is extremely dissimilar to the near neighbors selected for the database, the specificity with which SIANN detects that organism will decline (the rate of false positives will increase as the number of related genomes available in the database decreases). For example, if a database contained only E. coli and B.anthracis, a sample containing B. cereus would be misidentified as contraining B. anthracis. In the intended use case, a database targeting B. anthracis would contain B. cereus and a number of other near neighbors to prevent that kind of misidentification. It would be convenient to say that an ideal database can be made by calculating the ideal genetic distance between all references and then finding an ideal set of organisms to make up that database, but the behavior of any database will be governed by the particular genomes of the organisms it encounters in the wild. Because not all organisms evolve in the same manner (differences in mutation rate, horizontal gene transfer, recombination, etc), the suitability of a database and method to detect a given organism can only be determined by thorough validation and benchmarking, as well as updating the reference database as needed.

All of the programs in Table 1 were investigated for this effort, and three were chosen based on their ability to run on our high-performance computing cluster with an execution time and memory requirement that would be suitable to a clinical lab. Each program was run on a set of 600 simulated datasets generated by MetaSim (Richter, et al., 2008) . Each dataset consisted of 15,000,000 reads (100bp single-ended) with Illumina-simulated error (fourth-degree polynomial) (Korbel, et al., 2009) .

Kraken and LMAT both count the reads assigned to each taxon, MetaPhlAn calculates the abundance, and SIANN outputs a measure of the proportion of diagnostic genomic regions present. To put these measures on an even footing, we empirically calculated the false positive rate for each method over all 600 samples, at each possible measure of output. Because each dataset is made up of known organisms, any result can be classified as true or false. Therefore, for any possible result (say, 513 reads classified by LMAT or 1.6% abundance assigned by MetaPhlAn), one can calculate the proportion of calls with at least the same amount of support that were correct (True Positives/[True Positives+False Positives]), over all of the 600 datasets. That measure is commonly given as Positive Predictive Value (PPV). For each program, the results can be translated from the raw value into a PPV that is based on this empirical measure of error. The key item of interest is the PPV value for the results that we know to be true positives, the defined spike organisms. Another way of describing this approach is to say that the results of each program have been normalized to the false positive error rate that was empirically observed. If another set of samples were generated, the PPV vs. raw value curve ( Figure 2 ) would likely fall differently, but in this case it gives us a means of comparing a diverse set of methods against the same ground truth. If method 1 detects an organism with a higher PPV than method 2 does, it means that method 1 has fewer false positives in the range that it reports true positives, which is the definition of utility in this setting.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [{'start': 1339, 'end': 1347, 'text': 'Figure 2', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF0'}], 'section': 'Benchmarking'}, {'text': 'For each method, PPV was calculated as a function of raw output value.

Some simplification steps were taken, such as focusing on the specieslevel assignments (for comparison with methods that do not perform strain assignment), and only taking the top hit for each species from each dataset. Custom R and BASH scripts were used for the data compilation and analysis.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Benchmarking'}, {'text': 'The relationship of raw output value to PPV is shown for each of the four methods in Figure 2 . The point at which PPV is very close to 1 (where 95% of results are true positives) is ~41,000 reads for Kraken, ~2,800 reads for LMAT, ~38% abundance for MetaPhlAn, and 0.21 for SIANN. For SIANN this means that having 38% of the species-unique genome covered by reads resulted in the vast majority of calls being accurate. .

One could identify a read that aligns to a single species of bacteria with 100% accuracy over its 300bp length, with the next closest match being only 90% similar. It is extremely unlikely that a 300bp exact match would arise due to random chance, and so the user could say with confidence that the organism of interest is found within the sequence data (not considering contamination, horizontal gene transfer, etc). However, such an approach is not currently implemented in an automated method, and many of the steps needed to make that assertion are performed manually by a domain expert, including alignment to near neighbors and ensuring that the read does not fall within a transposon, plasmid, etc. Therefore, while one could say that a single read is all that is needed to state with high PPV that an organism is present, the amount of reads assigned in an automated manner needed to achieve that level of PPV will number in the thousands (Fig 2) . Table 2 ), and each program (boxes at top), across a maximum of 50 replicates (indicated by the size of each point).

To demonstrate this we plotted the known abundance of each spike organism against the PPV value generated by each method (Figure 3 ). Each point (an organism at a known level of abundance) is comprised of a maximum of 50 replicates, where the diameter of each point increases with an increasing number of replicates. For demonstration purposes we are showing two pairs of bacteria and three viruses. Recall that for each of the pairs of bacteria (and the two poxviruses) any sample containing one did not contain the other (as shown in Table 1 ). The empty boxes result from the organisms not being called at any abundance. For MetaPhlAn, that is a result of no viruses being included in the version of the reference database available for this analysis. Kraken assigned no reads to Hanta virus because viral RNA genomes were not included in this version of the reference database (personal communication with D. Wood). This emphasizes the point that a) the ability to create custom databases targeting organisms of interest can be valuable, and b) the performance of any method must be benchmarked against each potential target of interest.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [{'start': 460, 'end': 469, 'text': '(Figure 3', 'ref_id': 'FIGREF1'}, {'start': 875, 'end': 882, 'text': 'Table 1', 'ref_id': None}], 'section': 'Results'}, {'text': 'All methods were able identify the bulk of organisms in their databases at high abundances (75% and 18%, Figure 3 ), however performance varied considerably at lower abundances and depended on the particular organism and method used.

      " Next-generation sequencing is increasingly being used to study samples composed of mixtures of organisms, such as in clinical applications where the presence of a pathogen at very low abundance may be highly important. We present an analytical method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of target organisms in mixed samples that achieves a high degree of species-and strain-specificity by aligning short sequence reads to the genomes of near neighbor organisms, as well as that of the target. Empirical benchmarking alongside the current state-of-the-art methods shows an extremely high Positive Predictive Value, even at very low abundances of the target organism in a mixed sample. SIANN is available as an Illumina BaseSpace app, as well as through Signature Science, LLC. SIANN results are presented in a streamlined report designed to be comprehensible to the non-specialist user, providing a powerful tool for rapid species detection in a mixed sample. By focusing on a set of (customizable) target organisms and their near neighbors, SIANN can operate quickly and with low computational requirements while delivering highly accurate results.\n"

Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function.

It is the causative agent 47 of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a highly contagious disease of cloven-hooved animals 48 affecting most notably cattle, pigs, sheep and goats in addition to wild species such as the 49 African buffalo. Disease outbreaks have serious economic implications resulting from trade 50 restrictions, reduced productivity and the slaughter of infected and at-risk animals (1). The 51 2001 outbreak in the UK caused economic losses of over £8 billion to the tourism and 52 agricultural sectors. Inactivated virus vaccines are used in countries in which FMD is endemic, 53 but these are often strain-specific and provide little cross protection between serotypes (2). 54 Antigenic variation together with the relatively short duration of immunity following 55 vaccination combine to complicate control of the disease (3). In addition, the carrier state, in 56 which asymptomatically infected animals continue to shed virus, contributes to the spread of 57 FMDV (4).

The 2015 Korea outbreak of MERS-CoV involved 186 cases, including 38 fatalities. A total of 83% of transmission events were due to five superspreaders, and 44% of the 186 MERS cases were the patients who had been exposed in nosocomial transmission at 16 hospitals. The epidemic lasted for 2 months and the government quarantined 16,993 individuals for 14 days to control the outbreak. This outbreak provides a unique opportunity to fill the gap in our knowledge of MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in this paper, we review the literature on epidemiology, virology, clinical features, and prevention of MERS-CoV, which were acquired from the 2015 Korea outbreak of MERS-CoV.'"

       " abstract:In theoretical physics, there exist two basic mathematical approaches, algebraic and geometrical methods, which, in most cases, are complementary. In the area of genome sequence analysis, however, algebraic approaches have been widely used, while geometrical approaches have been less explored for a long time. The Z-curve theory is a geometrical approach to genome analysis. The Z-curve is a three-dimensional curve that represents a given DNA sequence in the sense that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other. The Z-curve, therefore, contains all the information that the corresponding DNA sequence carries. The analysis of a DNA sequence can then be performed through studying the corresponding Z-curve. The Z-curve method has found applications in a wide range of areas in the past two decades, including the identifications of protein-coding genes, replication origins, horizontally-transferred genomic islands, promoters, translational start sides and isochores, as well as studies on phylogenetics, genome visualization and comparative genomics. Here, we review the progress of Z-curve studies from aspects of both theory and applications in genome analysis."

       " abstract:Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia in 2012. The 2015 Korea outbreak of MERS-CoV involved 186 cases, including 38 fatalities. A total of 83% of transmission events were due to five superspreaders, and 44% of the 186 MERS cases were the patients who had been exposed in nosocomial transmission at 16 hospitals. The epidemic lasted for 2 months and the government quarantined 16,993 individuals for 14 days to control the outbreak. This outbreak provides a unique opportunity to fill the gap in our knowledge of MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in this paper, we review the literature on epidemiology, virology, clinical features, and prevention of MERS-CoV, which were acquired from the 2015 Korea outbreak of MERS-CoV."
